# Bird_Strike_Predictions
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting bird strike occurrences in aviation using machine learning techniques. The repository includes:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating patterns and trends in bird strike incidents.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes to predict bird strike occurrences.
Datasets: Utilizing cleaned and preprocessed datasets, including bird_strike_clean.csv and strike_reports11.csv.
